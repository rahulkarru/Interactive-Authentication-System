This project is basically a Interactive Authetication System 
We have use MERN and also some Hashing to save the data.

Work Flow 
use npm start
npm run dev 
to run the file Be cautious about the installations or done correctly 

 THE AIM OF THE PROJECT IS TO REPLACE THE PASSWORD WITH SOME SHAPES

 ?? Why don't we do the tresure lock which will be used in adventure movies as our authenticate ??
For Experimenting 
we done this Successfully
Our drawcanvas page says it all
i just compare to that method of adventure treasure
Step ONE:

Basically they had a thing kind of locket or a thing which will be placed in some position

We had given shapes in the place of those thing

Step TWO:

then they need to rotate that shape to some degrees....

we also given rotation to the selected shape which involves 360  rotation 

Step THREE:

then final step they need to place the points somewhere beside it with some adjustments 

for our selected shape we are using point placement where we need to align points on the edges 


Work Flow
